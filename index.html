                <h3>Your Privacy Matters</h3>
                <p><strong>We don't collect, share, or track any of your data. Period.</strong> Everything you create stays on your device, under your control.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the TodoList & Kanban Board application ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information. Our commitment is simple: we respect your privacy by not collecting any personal data whatsoever.</p>

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> The App operates entirely on your device without any need to transmit data to external servers.</p>

            <h3>What We Don't Collect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
                <li>Usage data or analytics</li>
                <li>Device information</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Cookies or tracking identifiers</li>
                <li>IP addresses</li>
                <li>Any other form of data or metadata</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All your tasks, boards, and application settings are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using your browser's local storage or device storage capabilities. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
                <li>We have no access to your information</li>
                <li>You maintain complete control over your data</li>
                <li>Your data persists only on your device unless you manually delete it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not share any data</strong> because we don't collect any data in the first place. There are no third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or any other external services integrated into the App that could access your information.</p>

            <h2>Tracking and Analytics</h2>
            <p><strong>The App does not use any tracking, analytics, or monitoring tools.</strong> We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track your usage patterns</li>
                <li>Monitor which features you use</li>
                <li>Collect any behavioral data</li>
                <li>Use cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
                <li>Implement any form of user analytics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App does not integrate with or utilize any third-party services, APIs, or external resources that could access your data. The App is completely self-contained and operates independently on your device.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeping your device secured with a password or biometric authentication</li>
                <li>Maintaining up-to-date operating system and browser software</li>
                <li>Being cautious about who has physical access to your device</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Backup and Export</h2>
            <p>Because your data is stored locally on your device, it is your responsibility to back up your information if desired. We recommend periodically backing up your device or using any export features the App may provide to save your data elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we don't collect data, there are no special considerations needed for children's privacy beyond the general privacy protections inherent in our local-only approach.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect any data about you, traditional data protection rights (such as access, deletion, or correction of data) are not applicable in the traditional sense. However, you have complete control over your locally stored data and can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delete all app data through your browser or device settings</li>
                <li>Clear specific tasks or boards within the App</li>
                <li>Uninstall the App at any time, which will remove all local data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes, so we encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

            <h2>Open Source and Transparency</h2>
            <p>We believe in transparency. For open-source implementations, the App's code can be inspected to verify that we do not collect, transmit, or share any data.</p>

            <h2>Questions About This Policy</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please note that since we don't collect any data, there is no user data for us to access, modify, or delete on your behalf. All data remains exclusively on your device under your control.</p>

            <h2>Jurisdiction and Legal Compliance</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with privacy regulations worldwide, including GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), and other applicable privacy laws. Since we don't collect any personal data, we inherently comply with the most stringent privacy requirements.</p>
